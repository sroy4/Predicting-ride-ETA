# Using Gradient Boosting for predicting NYC Cab Trip duration
### Overview 
Many on-demand logistics companies like Uber, Ola, and Lyft are displaying their predicted ETA for an enhanced customer experience. Predicting accurate estimated time arrival is imperative to logistics providers as well to differentiate from the competitors. Predicting arrival time is not always accurate as few situations are inherently unpredictable such as the weather and sudden spike in demand in certain neighborhoods.The main things I am going to focus on are the sort of features such a setup takes and how to create such features. 


### Goal
To predict the arrival time of a cab in NY city for different weather & locations.
